## SOLID PRINCIPLES

- ➡️ Single Responsibility

  Each class should have only one sole purpose, and
  not to be filled with excessive functionality.

- ➡️️ Open Closed

  Classes should be open for extension,
  closed for modification.

  In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class
  for implementing new features

- ➡️️ Liskov Substitution Principle

  This means that every subclass or
  derived class should be substitutable for their
  base or parent class.

  > See the `NoShape.java` class for the meaning of this principle.

- ➡️️ Interface Segregation Principle
  Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do.
  Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

- ➡️️ Dependency Inversion
  Components should depend on abstractions and not on concretions.
